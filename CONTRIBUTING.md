# Guidelines

* If you make any changes to the [API Interceptors](), ensure the tests still pass
* Don't commit without using prettier beforehand
* Write sensible commit names and descriptions 
* Try your best to follow the style of aero
* Please don't use the built-in Github Web Editor (The non-VSCode one) to commit multi-file changes. Nobody wants to see an overload of commits. I will know if you do this.
