Aero is a safe, developer friendly, and innovative interception proxy with many features. Aero provides full site support without much delay, while also having a clean and organized codebase.

A deployable version can be found [here](https://github.com/ProxyHaven/aero-deploy)
It is highly recommended that you install [aero middleware](https://github.com/ProxyHaven/Middleware) for enchanced functionality.

## Read the docs!

You can find the documentation in /docs
If you are interested in contributing, I recommend installing [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree]; aero's issues and ideas are documented by TODOs. It should be easy to determine the future direction of the project. You could always [email me](mailto:inbox@ryanwilson.space) with questions.

## Directories

-   **src** - Aero's _actual_ code
-   **src/this** - The SW code (aero's base). Alternative backends are found in _backend_.
-   **src/browser** - Code that is injected into the site. This consists of [API Interceptors]().
-   **src/worker** - Basically, browser but for [nested workers]()
-   **src/shared** - Code used by _this_ and _browser_
    -   **src/shared/autoProxy** - [API Interceptor]() base code
-   **backend** - Alternative aero backends (Non SW) for certain environments
-   **tests** - Unit testing
-   **dist** - Build files for aero. This is what you actually need to use aero on your site. These won't be present until you run `npm run build`.
