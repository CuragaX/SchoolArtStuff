Aero is a safe, developer-friendly, innovative interception web proxy with many features. Aero provides full site support without delay and has a clean, organized codebase.

## What is a web proxy?

Web proxies are website libraries that work to emulate the functionality of the site that you want. They do this by intercepting API calls and rewriting documents to emulate as if it was under the proxied origin.

Web Proxies can be used for:

- Bypassing any browsing restrictions in a sandbox
- Unblocking websites or browser features through emulation
- Middleware

## How do I become a proxy dev?

That's great to hear! Sadly, there aren't many people who have an interest in this up-and-coming field. Proxies have more uses than unblocking; until recently, their potential has been unrealized.

I recommend reading the proxy guide. TODO: Link to the proxy guide.
I recommend reading the [Index for the Dev Docs](./docs/For%20devs/README.md). This information is valuable, even if you want to build your proxy! It's a great place to start and to put everything into perspective; I made this decision because I understand that seeing a sea of doc files is intimidating, and you may need help knowing where to start. Please don't let complexity dissuade you from your ambitions! Once you break it down, proxies have become much simpler due to recent innovations.
