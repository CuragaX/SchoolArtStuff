Aero is a safe, developer-friendly, innovative interception web proxy with many features. Aero provides full site support without delay and has a clean, organized codebase.

## What is a web proxy?

Web proxies are website libraries that work to emulate the functionality of the site that you want. They do this by intercepting API calls and rewriting documents to emulate as if it was under the proxied origin.

Web Proxies can be used for:

- Bypassing any browsing restrictions in a sandbox
- Unblocking websites or browser features through emulation
- Middleware

## How to build aero

```
npm i
npm run build
```
