Aero is a safe, developer friendly, and innovative interception web proxy with many features. Aero provides full site support without much delay, while also having a clean and organized codebase.

## What is a web proxy?

Web proxies are website libraries that work to emulate the functionality site that you want. They do this by intercepting API calls and rewriting documents to emulate as if it was under the proxied origin.

Web Proxies can be used for:

- Bypassing any browsing restrictions in a sandbox
- Unblocking websites or browser features through emulation
- Middleware

## How do I become a proxy dev?

That's great to hear! Sadly, there aren't many people who actually have an interest in this very promising field. Proxies have more uses than just unblocking and until recently, the potential of them has been unrealized.

I would recommend by reading the [Index for the Dev Docs](./docs/For%20devs/Index.md). This information is valueable, even if you want to build your own proxy! It's a great place to start and to put everything into perspective; I made this because I understand seeing a sea of doc files is intimidating and you may not know where to start. Please don't let complexity dissuade you from your ambitions! Once you break it down, proxies have become much simpiler in recent years, due to recent innovations.
