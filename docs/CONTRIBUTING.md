# Guidelines

-   Don't commit without using prettier beforehand
-   Don't use the built-in Github Web Editor (Not vscode.dev) to commit multi-file changes. I will know if you do this, and I will deny your pull request. If this happens again, you will be blocked
-   Write sensible commit names and descriptions
-   Try your best to follow the style of aero
-   If you make any changes to the [API Interceptors](), ensure the tests still pass

# Tips

-   If you are on VSCode, install the recommended extensions
-   If you want to find something to contribute to, search in your editor for TODO comments and look in TODO.xit for generalized ideas
-   If you want to learn aero's codebase faster, **please read all of the docs**
