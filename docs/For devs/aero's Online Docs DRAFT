# Aero's online docs üìù

This will be found on <https://docs.vyper.group/aero>

Aero will use

1. Docs: [Docusarious](https://docusaurus.io/)
2. Searching: [DOCSEARCH](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) [Typesense](https://docsearch.algolia.com)
3. AI assistance I would like to have something like [inkeep](https://inkeep.com/), but FOSS or more affordable

> Many of these choices were inspired by [Bun's docs](https://bun.sh/docs) which are very well made

## Typings

It is important that JSDoc comments and the JS types are configured accurately

## Links / references

With Docusarious, I will have the links instead of linking to another file in the Github, link to relvant parts of the source

## Subsectioning

## TODO

All of the TODO.md files will be joined into one single file with each files subheadings being incremented by one level

## AeroSandbox

There will be the obvious seperation of the docs from aero and AeroSandbox

## Considerations

- There is the possibly that down the road, I may find it useful to move the MD files outside of this repo itself
