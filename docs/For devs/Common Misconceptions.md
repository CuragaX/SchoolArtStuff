# Common misconceptions

- Server-only: When I say this I am usually referring to running the SW code in the web server instead.
- Backend: The code that the _user_ doesn't see. Usually this refers to using different implementations of the same thing. For example, you may refer to a bare server as a bare backend. This is because there are varying implementations to the standard, however bare is not a backend proxy server, it is the _bare_ proxy itself.
