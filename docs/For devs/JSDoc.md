# JSDoc

[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started) allows you to annotate JS files in a human readable way, and as a result have them appear in your IDE or they can be generated into websites. I still recommend TS for type annotations though.

I recommend adding to the top of your files a header with the description and @see block tags that link to the relevant standards. I also recommend specifying where the module should be used and how it is built, if it is a part of a submodule.
