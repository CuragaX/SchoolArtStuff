# Profitablility

This isn't a topic I like to speak about. These comments below do not reflect my opinions on monetization.

## Misconceptions

One of the biggest misconceptions is that proxies aren't profitable. This is partly because of the misconception that proxies are only for Kâ€“12 bypassing, which I talked about previously. You would be surprised at how niche startups can be profitable. All you need is venture capital (which I don't recommend) or at least one loyal enterprise to appeal to. The most common method of monetization that has been tried is premium subscriptions. This took off around the time when the COVID-19 pandemic paranoia occurred, when it made the most sense. It's a great method; however, most communities aren't giving anything that is worth subscribing to. Offer some unique services that are based on new proxy technology on the side, and magic will happen. Also, with ads being blocked on AdSense, you can partially bypass that with anti-filter detection, which I will explain in #5: Why most link protection methods are flawed and how these issues are mitigated. #5: Why most link protection methods are flawed and how these issues are mitigated. Proper anti-filter detection would also make you need fewer domains and, therefore, fewer expenses.

## Offer unique services

It is really important that you do more than just unblock. Seriously, magic will happen. With newly created proxy middleware standards, you have an excuse for not being able to use proxies in other ways than just unblocking sites. It is true that proxies are hard to monetize, but proxy technology can be used for so much more than just unblocking. Think about it. Many of these will have a much greater appeal to those who have money than to broke students.
