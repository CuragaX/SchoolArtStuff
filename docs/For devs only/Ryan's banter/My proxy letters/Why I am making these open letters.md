# WHy I am making these open letters

These documents will explain why I believe current proxies and their communities are flawed and how I propose they should be fixed. They explain the motives for my projects. I also state what I believe the potential is of proxies. I only mean to criticize communities, not shame specific ones. There is no intended bias here.

> #1 to #3 are written for proxy site owners, and the others are for developers.
