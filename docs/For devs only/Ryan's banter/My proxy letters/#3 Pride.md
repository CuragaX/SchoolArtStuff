# Pride

Seriously, Pride will destroy your entire staff team most quickly. It is a sin in almost every religion.

Proverbs 16:18 “Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.”

## Internal Conflicts

You might've noticed this with TN. Because of their board-like structure, many hostile takeovers have happened over the years. It all started with Horsey4 and IronApple a long time ago. Despite this, the most common instance of this being an issue is with external conflicts.

## External Conflicts

There is no real animosity between proxy site staff. It's merely an illusion, for real. It's all for the sake of competition.

## My thoughts on reputation

When someone innovates, they are bound to have enemies. For this reason, never deny someone based on their reputation as a whole. You must consider this yourself. Also, no real users actually care about external drama; they just want working links. Adversely, canceling someone will only make them more popular. If you recruit someone who left another community, you will likely be told many lies by others due to them not wanting their talented developers to thrive in another competitor's space.

## My thoughts on skiddery

There is also the problem of people being classified and blacklisted as skids. This happened to communities like Things and Interstellar. People change very easily, and it might not even be the owners who are offended. Many people consider skidding to be the first stage of being a programmer. Also, don't get mad when someone copies your idea. It happens to everyone, and there is nothing that can be done about it.

## Work with other communities

Nobody is above working with another proxy community or using services from another. It's hard to implement everything yourself. Countless times, many proxy server owners have approached me to work for them on developing an idea that already exists and without meaningful improvements, and when questioned, they say that they are trying to have something of their own. You won't be looked at any better if you copy someone else. You gain popularity by doing something that is different; otherwise, you go nowhere. I will talk about this in the next letter.

### Talk to other staff in the community

I have gained so much valuable insight, especially from this document, by asking for criticisms of my own work. Accept that you are a flawed person. Don't get mad when someone asks for change. Everyone needs to be open-minded for us to all prosper. Their ideas are just as meaningful as yours. The proxy community has taught me: there is always room for improvement.
