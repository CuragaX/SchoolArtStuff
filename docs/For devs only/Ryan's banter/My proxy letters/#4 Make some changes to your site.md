# Make some changes to your site

It doesn't help that proxy sites function nearly the same as each other. There is hardly ever innovation or a motivation to change. Nobody knows what to change. Sure, we can have multiple proxies and a backend switcher. We have already reached the end stages of unblocking sites. We now need to focus on unblocking more than just sites. I believe the only possible way of innovating nowadays is through proxy middleware. It's the only way your site will standout in the oversatured proxy market that consists of fancy search boxes to a proxy.

## The future in my eyes

I can tell you that I realized the full potential of proxy sites a long time ago. I believe proxy sites in their utopia will be exactly the same as a conventional web browser, rather than trying to mimic individual sites. We have already made the transition from reverse proxies to the proxies we have today. And I think this will be the next step. Through the advent of enterprise browser policies in the browser, useful and essential features for browsing the web are being disabled for workers and now students. This is horrible. It gives them less efficiency to do the tasks they need. We need to focus on unblocking these features by emulating them. This is why I initiated [FoxyWeb](x).
