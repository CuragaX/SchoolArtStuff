# Take some risks on recruiting developers

## Loosing developers

Before I can talk about why proxy sites are flawed, I need to explain what is happening to older communities right now. Graduating K-12 students are causing them to lose developers, and in TN’s case, a toxic community is upsetting them more prominently. Developers who quit because they are graduating feel like they personally can't move on with the projects because they believe the proxy community is too niche to be profitable when they move into the real world. It's not greed; they need to live a sustainable life. That is the #1 priority when you move on. There are a lot of problems with this thinking. Proxies have way more uses than just unblocking, and it is a common misconception that unblocking has to do with just schools. Countries and workplaces are another concern. You could either move on from the oversaturated unblocker trend or instead try to globalize your proxies and advertise to more than the K–12 market.

## There are a ton to choose

Besides all this, losing developers isn't the end of the world. Almost all developers in the community are school students. Most communities, like TN, are only looking for the most talented developers. This is unrealistic because you likely aren't paying your developers much or even at all. You don't have a pool to select from; however, many want to work for you when you get good ideas. You must let them learn on their own and train them, supporting them the entire way. This is what I mean by taking chances. Likely, the only reason why there are people wanting to help you is because they want to learn something themselves, because there is nothing else enticing right now. Otherwise, they would simply make their own community. They seek your guidance.
