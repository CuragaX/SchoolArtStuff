# Why doesn't aero work on iOS?

The bug is Apple's fault not ours, since Safari doesn't fully support the Service Worker standard. This would normally be fine in most mobile operating systems but due to the restrictions apple imposes on the apps, browsers are forced to use Safari's engine. This yet another problem with monopolies and proprietary software.
