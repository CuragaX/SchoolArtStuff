# The HTML attribute rewriting methods - DRAFT

## Parser method

This won't be included in aero, due to it causing double parsing, which slows down the proxy and is against aero's goals.

> This was the only traditional method of HTML attribute rewriting, prior to aero's existance.

## MutationObserver method

HTML is intercepted and rewritten through a Mutation Observer where important elements are rewritten. Script elements with inline code and elements with integrity values set need to be cloned due to the browser's security restrictions.
> This was the original method adopted by aero

## ü•à Custom Elements + Rewriting the is attribute

This doesn't use MutationObservers and is faster than the traditional method, because it doesn't intercept every HTML attribute. It also works in browsers that don't support Mutation Observers but support custom elements.

> This is used in Faker

1. Create a custom element that extends the native element
2. For that element, add the is attribute set to the custom element, when it is created. You can do this in a mutation observer, but you could also do it then.
> Here are two methods that would work without a MutationObserver or Mutation Events
    - Inserting the HTML through the DOM APIs in a script and add the is property to all of them that way
    - Register a Mutation Observer that rewrites all of the native elements to use add the is property


## Shadow DOM containerizing

I'm going to do my research to find out, if it is possible to do this without the is property, by running the entire site's HTML in a shadow dom. This could make it so that attributes don't need to be hidden at all, saving the need for intercepting JS APIs. If this works, this would be the perfect solution.

### üèÜ Attribute Emulation method

This doesn't use mutation events, mutation observers, or web components

As you probably know, when you overwrite a property it looses its functionality. You would instead have to make a custom element that extends a native one, if you want to maintain functionality and intercept (proxy). This avoids the need for that. Every current HTML element that needs to be rewritten can actually be overwritten and emulated.
 
For example here's the attribute:

 - href - You can add a click event, that uses window.open, and disable functionality of href, making you respect the rel attribute. When using href for linking stylesheets, this is a bit tricky. You would have to inline the stylesheets.
    - [ ] Find out if inline stylesheets are different from external ones
 - meta - Some of these attributes will have to be emulated
 - src - You will have to inline the script and then hide the innerHTML. While inlining, you need to inject a single line that proxies document.scriptElement to return one that doesn't have the rewritten attributes, similarly to how document.scriptElement needs to be proxied so that integrity seems to still. You will also have to run it all inside of a scope {}, so that it can't access unscoped vars from other scripts.
   - [ ] Find out if document.scriptElement is accessible inside of a script 
 - integrity - This needs to be emulated anyways, due to the script being rewritten, so it doesn't actually matter

I might be able to make a shadow dom polyfill. Now that I think about it, Google also provides a polyfill, so maybe they use these kinds of interception techniques. TODO: Look at it.
