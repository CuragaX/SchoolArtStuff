# TODOs

- [ ] Implement auto api interception

- [x] Deprecate autoProxy. It's a dumb gimmick originally made to save me from keystrokes. I will still keep the strings method. I will rename autoProxy to strings proxy

- [ ] In html.ts, instead of keeping an attribute to mark the element, store them in a WeakMap, so they can automatically be cleaned up by the garbage man

- [ ] Move all of the middleware code into a modified BareClient

- [ ] Seperate the package.json for middleware. Then, cleanup the package.json.

- [ ] Provide auto-builds

- [ ] Implement url encoding

- [ ] Support Safari (Read Faq for more info)

- [ ] Fix HTTP and STS Emulation

- [ ] Support XML/XSLT documents

- [ ] Aero sandboxing library

- [ ] Support nested SWs

- [ ] Support proxifying MutationEvents (deprecated) before they are removed from Chrome soon - https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#interface-mutationevent

- [ ] Migrate the HTML Rewrites to the the rewriting rules
