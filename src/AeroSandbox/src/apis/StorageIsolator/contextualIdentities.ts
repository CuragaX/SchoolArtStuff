// This specific part will be one of the APIs brought by the AeroSandbox Runtime Library
// TODO: This will be a port of the contextual identities API from Firefox to anywhere. The only catch is that you must implement AeroSandbox built with the StorageIsolator API feature flags on. It is already the job of your SW to inject AeroSandbox into every part of your site, but we are going to give your SW one more job for this functionality. This will, of course, be done appropriately through swAdditions.
