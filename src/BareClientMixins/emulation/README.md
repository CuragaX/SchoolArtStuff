# BareClient with emulation support

This will be just like how I moved the middleware code out of aero's sw handler and into a bare client mixin, but instead with cache and security emulation. Emulation is main factors of aero's instability, and this abstraction means a lot for stability. It also brings aero's innovative techniques to any proxy that conforms to the bare standard.
