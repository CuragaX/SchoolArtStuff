# Middleware

Middleware is [important](Link to my proxy letter). middleware makes your life easier by not having to know the internals for every proxy you want to support, and instead allow you to write once, use anywhere.

Read [the types](types/index.d.ts), if you want to learn how the middleware works.

## Directories

- DL/ - This is the root directory
  - Bridges - Backwards compatibility with middleware with middleware from other proxies
  - Examples/ - Examples
  - Features/ - Extra functionality for proxies that can be configured with documented message channel APIs.
  - Features/UI - UI that gives the user control for the middleware. This is an essential, because otherwise the middleware installed is up to the proxy site hoster.
  - Browser/ - For my [browser port projects](Link to the browser port manifesto)
  - Privacy Tools/ - Middleware that hides your identity
