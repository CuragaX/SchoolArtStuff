# Middleware

Middleware is extremely important for all proxy sites. Without middleware you proxy site will essentially be another clone with a search bar to a proxy, a bare server switcher, and whatever gimmick you can think of. Middleware makes your life easier by not having to know the internals for every proxy you want to support, and instead allow you to write once, use anywhere. You don't even have to know what a proxy is to be able to write Middleware.
